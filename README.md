# ISA TO TENY

![GitDash Preview](/public/capture/Capture_ecran.png)
**Isa to Teny** is a web application built with [Angular](https://angular.io/) that allows users to **convert numbers into words in Malagasy**.  
It was created to make reading and writing numbers in the Malagasy language easier and more accessible.

---

## ðŸš€ Development Server

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:  
[http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)  
The app will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## ðŸ›  Code Scaffolding

Angular CLI provides powerful tools for generating components. To create a new component:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a full list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

---

## ðŸ§± Building the Project

To build the application for production:

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. The production build is optimized for speed and performance.

---

## ðŸ§ª Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests using the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner:

```bash
ng test
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Running End-to-End Tests

To run end-to-end (e2e) tests:

```bash
ng e2e
```

> Note: Angular CLI does not include an e2e framework by default. You can use one that fits your needs (e.g., Cypress, Playwright, or Protractor).
